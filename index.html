                        <div class="news-title">Trump says India 'will do what's right' on illegal immigration</div>
                        <div class="news-desc">US President Donald Trump has said India "will do what's right" on the deportation of illegal migrants following a phone call with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.  
                            <br><br>
                            The leaders spoke on Monday, their first conversation since Trump's inauguration last week. They discussed immigration, security issues, and trade in what the White House described as a "productive call". Trump told reporters after the call that Modi was likely to visit the United States "sometime in February".  
                            <br><br>
                            Since taking office on 20 January, Trump has announced a number of immigration-related executive orders, paving the way for a widespread effort to crack down on undocumented migrants in the US.  
                            <br><br>
                            According to the Pew Research Center, there are an estimated 725,000 undocumented Indian immigrants in the US as of 2024. Last week, India's foreign ministry said Delhi would take in Indians overstaying "anywhere in the world" as long as their documents were shared and nationality was verified.  
                            <br><br>
                            In their phone call on Monday, the ministry said, Trump and Modi discussed the bilateral relationship, "including in the areas of technology, trade, investment, energy and defence".  
                            <br><br>
                            The two leaders also discussed security in the Indo-Pacific, the Middle East, and Europe. According to a White House statement, Trump emphasised the importance of India increasing its procurement of US-made security equipment and moving towards a "fair" bilateral trading relationship.  
                            <br><br>
                            In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Modi called Trump a "dear friend" and said they were "committed to a mutually beneficial and trusted partnership". The White House said both leaders emphasised their commitment to advancing their countries' strategic partnership and the Indo-Pacific Quad partnership, which also includes Japan and Australia. India will be hosting Quad leaders for the first time later this year.  
                            <br><br>
                            Modi and Trump shared cordial relations during the US president's first term between 2017 and 2021. But India faced a bitter tariff war with the Trump administration that affected businesses on both sides.  
                            <br><br>
                            In November, following Trump's election victory, India's Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar said the country was not nervous about working with the US president. Trump had called Modi a "great leader" last year but also accused India of charging excessive tariffs. Analysts say it will be interesting to watch if the bonhomie between the two will help overcome concerns about trade and immigration.

                        <div class="news-desc">The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is gearing up for its historic 100th mission, scheduled for launch on January 29, 2025, at 6:23 AM IST from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota. This milestone mission will see the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV-F15) deploying the NVS-02 satellite, a second-generation addition to India's Navigation with Indian Constellation (NavIC) system. 
                            
                            The NVS-02 satellite is designed to enhance India's regional navigation capabilities, offering improved accuracy and coverage. Notably, this launch marks the first mission under the leadership of ISRO's new Chairman, V. Narayanan, who assumed office on January 13, 2025. 
                            
                            The GSLV-F15 mission represents the 17th flight of the GSLV series and the 11th utilizing the indigenously developed cryogenic engine, underscoring India's advancements in space technology. 
                            
                            The countdown for this landmark mission commenced 27 hours prior to the scheduled liftoff, with all systems undergoing final checks to ensure a successful launch. The NVS-02 satellite is expected to significantly bolster India's navigation infrastructure, providing a range of applications across various sectors.
                            
                            As the nation anticipates this significant event, the successful deployment of NVS-02 will further solidify ISRO's reputation for excellence in space exploration and technology.</div>

                        <div class="news-desc">As the Union Budget 2025 approaches, there is significant anticipation regarding potential changes in India's income tax structure. Taxpayers, particularly from the middle class, are hopeful for adjustments that could alleviate the financial pressures they face. The current 30% tax bracket is perceived as burdensome, reducing disposable income and making it challenging to manage rising living costs. Many are optimistic that the upcoming budget will address these concerns by revising tax slabs or introducing relief measures.

                            In the lead-up to the budget announcement, various stakeholders have proposed initiatives aimed at economic stimulation and social welfare. For instance, the State Bank of India (SBI) has recommended the implementation of a Universal Income Scheme and comprehensive tax reforms. Such proposals are designed to bolster economic growth and provide a safety net for vulnerable populations.
                            
                            Additionally, recent data indicates a significant increase in the number of individuals filing zero-income tax returns, which has more than doubled in recent years. This trend highlights the need for a more inclusive and equitable tax system that broadens the tax base while ensuring fairness.
                            
                            As the budget date approaches, all eyes are on the government's fiscal strategies and their potential impact on taxpayers across the nation.</div>
